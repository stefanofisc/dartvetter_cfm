/home/s.fiscale/anaconda3/envs/torchcfm/lib/python3.10/site-packages/xgboost/core.py:265: FutureWarning: Your system has an old version of glibc (< 2.28). We will stop supporting Linux distros with glibc older than 2.28 after **May 31, 2025**. Please upgrade to a recent Linux distro (with glibc 2.28+) to use future versions of XGBoost.
Note: You have installed the 'manylinux2014' variant of XGBoost. Certain features such as GPU algorithms or federated learning are not available. To use these features, please upgrade to a recent Linux distro with glibc 2.28+, and install the 'manylinux_2_28' variant.
